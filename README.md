# Tinku: The Ultimate Mood Analyzer


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Pinnacle


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Alan Subhash - Muthoot Institute Of Technology And Science


### Project Description
An interactive AI Avatar named Tinku that listens to users through speech and text and provide them with relevant video clips from different movies and play various songs or suggest playlists that best defines the mood of the user.

### The Problem
Ever felt like your emotions are too complex for mere humans to understand? Tinku is here to solve the "problem" of humans having to guess what they feel like watching or listening to based on their moods. No more stressful decision-making! Imagine a world where you don't have to scroll endlessly through playlists or movie recommendations to find the perfect match for your vibe — Tinku does it all for you, instantly tuning into your feelings (even those you didn’t know you had!). Finally, an AI that "gets you" when you're just *too tired* to get yourself.

### The Solution 
Enter Tinku, your virtual mood guru! Tinku uses state-of-the-art mood-detection (okay, mostly guesses) to figure out what you need, even when you don’t. Feeling sad? Tinku’s got a movie clip to melt away the blues. Overflowing with happiness? Here comes a celebratory playlist! Whether you're stressed, annoyed, or having a full-blown existential crisis, Tinku is ready with an overly specific video clip or the exact song you didn’t know you needed. And hey, because scrolling through Netflix or Spotify is way too 2023, right?
